# How To Play
ConsoleSolitaire is a normal solitaire game, using the main.py. Please keep it maximized on the screen, or otherwise the ascii arts will break.

When on the main page, you will be able to use any letter to start a new game.

When inside a game, you will see the two boards (The main board and the winning columns). You will be able to switch between the columns using A and D.

When you press enter, you will select the card that's highlighted in blue and you will be asked for the column to put it. You will be able to choose it using A and D, and there will be an overhead light blue block that will show you the column you're selecting.

When you're choosing one card, you can also select more than one at once by using W and S. It can be useful when moving entire columns.

You will be able to use "P" to pick a card from the remaining deck. You will be shown the card (the red text on the bottom) and will be asked where to place it. You can also choose to discard it using "Q".

You can also choose to surrender the game by pressing "Z". There will be a confirmation popup: If you write "Y" the game will close, while if you touch any other keyboard button the game will continue normally.
